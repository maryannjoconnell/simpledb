There's one major bug: If the server is (forcefully) shutdown for some reason (to switch
the replacement policy for example), then on its next startup the server will
be unable to recover the database and will crash. This does not seem to be something
that is part of our addition and as such unfortunately it's hard to debug. It should
not however interfere with correctness; as a workaround the server's database folder
shold be completely wiped clean every start up. The tests are also fairly self-contained
as a result; they will do all the necessary table creation.
